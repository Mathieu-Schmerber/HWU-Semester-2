## F21GC â€“ Games Production Practice and Playtesting Evaluation

**Author**: Mathieu Schmerber

This repository contains my submissions for the 2nd semester of my game design master.
It includes all of the source code of the 4 game prototypes I made, alongside their build files.

Each prototype folder contains:

- **/Sources**: The raw C# source code
- **/Build**: The necessary component to build and test the game
  - **README.md**: Build instructions
